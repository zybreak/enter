Compiling and Installation
--------------------------

The following is needed to compile:
- imlib2
- freetype2

then run ./configure, make and make install as usual.
Or see `INSTALL' for more info.
If you've downloaded enter from SVN, you need to run
`autoreconf' first to generate the configure script.

Usage
------------

To use enter you first need to make sure the configuration `enter.conf'
is in order. Then just run `enter' at the shell prompt.
Enter should ideally be put in a initscript.
