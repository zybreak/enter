Critical priority
* Add PAM authentication support.
* Add NLS support.
* Fork the GUI process and drop privileges.
* Let the GUI and the authentication code communicate through IPC.
* Don't rely on the existance of ~/.xinitrc.
  Maybe we should fallback on /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc?
* Update man-pages and debian build.

Moderate priority
* Add Doxygen comments.
* Add buttons and animations.
* Add XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1.

Low priority
* Add support for actions other than login (shutdown, hibernate).
